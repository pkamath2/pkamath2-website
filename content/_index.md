I am a Ph.D. graduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and creativity by building intelligent interactive tools. My research interests lie at the intersection of Generative AI algorithms and interaction design for audio. I am being advised by [Dr. Suranga Nanayakkara](https://suranga.info/), [Dr. Kokil Jaidka](https://kokiljaidka.wordpress.com/), and [Dr. Lonce Wyse](https://lonce.org/). 

<span style="background-color: yellow;">I am currently looking for <span style="font-weight: bold;">generative AI opportunities in the industry</span>. Please reach out if you are hiring. </span>

Before NUS, I worked in the industry for ~15 years in various roles. I helped build and architect solutions for various financial institutions, such as Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, and consulting organizations, such as Capgemini and Oliver Wyman. 

I believe that we all need to do more to improve gender diversity in tech. I co-founded the [Women Who Code network in Singapore](https://womenwhocode.com/singapore) in 2016 and led the network in the city as a [Director](https://str.sg/UaDP) until 2020. I was also involved in building developer communities as a DevRel advocate for [YOW! Conferences](https://yowconference.com/) in the city. I also previously volunteered for tech-for-good organizations such as [Techladies](https://techladies.co/), [Engineers.sg](https://techladies.co/) and [DataKind.SG](https://www.datakind.org/blog/datadiving-with-datakind-singapore) and am constantly looking for opportunities to give back to the community.
